MRI is an imaging modality which uses extremely strong magnets and radio waves to generate images of parts of the body which can’t be seen as well with CT, X-ray or ultrasound. It does not involve ionising radiation. 

## Before the Scan

Before an MRI scan, the patient will be required to answer a safety screening questionnaire to ensure they understand the safety concerns and assess their past medical history. As the magnets used in MRI are extremely strong, any objects with ferrous material will be attracted to the scanner. This means any bodily implants or pacemakers will have to be assessed to ensure they will not cause damage to the patient when placed inside the scanner. The patient will also be required to remove all metal from their person and change into a hospital gown.

## During the Scan

During an MRI scan, the patient will lie on a table which moves into the scanner. The scanner can be very loud, but there is a call bell which can be pressed to get the radiographer’s attention if needed. Music may be played through headphones to calm the patient if they find the noise very disruptive. The scanner is open at each end and cool air can be blown through to make the process more comfortable. In total, the scan will take 30-50 mins.

## What is MRI looking for in COVID-19 Patients?

MRI can be used to look at patients with pneumonia should the doctor not want to expose the patient to ionising radiation from CT or general x-rays. It can also be used to scan for any abnormalities, or neurological damage, caused by the [side effects of COVID-19]({{< ref "/docs/what-is-covid/_index.md" >}}).
