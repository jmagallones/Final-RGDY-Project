So the doctor has recommended you for a scan, what now? We'll go through the process of what happens _before_ you meet the ladies and gentlemen at the radiography department for the scan.

## What to Expect as a Patient

Before undergoing the examination the patient should remove all artefacts such as jewellery and bras. They will be given a hospital gown and asked to change into it. They will be asked several safety questions which they are expected the answer honestly too. Some of these questions may be to determine if a female patient is pregnant.

The exam will take place in a clean room. The patient will be told in simple terms what is going to be done. They will be informed of the benefits of having it done and the consequences of not having it done aswell as the risks the patients may attract themselves to be undergoing the procedure. You may be asked about other CT and other x-ray procedures you have had in the past to determine if it is safe to expose the body to more radiation. Don’t worry, the examination would not be recommended unless the benefits of having it done are greater than the risks of not having it done.

A non-contrast, single phase, low radiation dose chest CT is usually what is used to evaluate patients with covid19. During the examination the patient will be expected to lie on the table with their arms over their head. Some people may have discomfort lying on the table so it’s important you are comfortable before the procedure begins.  The radiographer will position the patient and they must stay in that position unless told to move.  The table that the patient is lying on will move through the gantry to the x-ray tube and detector. The x-ray tube rotates around the patient and the detector gathers the requires information and transports it to the computer which will form the images. The examination will be completed when all the necessary images are got. It is a quick procedure that lasts about 10 minutes. The patient should practise with the radiographer holding their breath for short periods of time before they have to do this during the examination.

The scans will be reported by the radiologist and the results will then be sent to the patient’s doctor.

For treatment of COVID-19, some patients stay in ICU for about 2 weeks and others with milder cases stay for 3-4 days. Some patients have even longer stays and the recovery period can be extremely long. 

During the hospital stay you will have many routine observations by nursing staff and healthcare assistants. Your blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and oxygen levels will be checked, how frequently this occurs depends on how serious your condition is. Blood tests will also be performed to help monitor the condition.

The staff will be wearing personal equipment such as gloves, a mask and an apron to help stop the spread of infection. The staff will help you with self care, cleaning and eating if you need assistance and your meals will be provided. 

As part of routine ward rounds, doctors will visit daily. They will ask you simple questions and will examine you further if they need to. 

Oxygen is the main treatment for this virus. The decision about the care you receive will be mainly determined by your oxygen levels.

## What to Expect as a Patient Going into a CT Exam?

In preparing for the CT exam all artefacts are removed. You may be asked to change into a hospital gown and rehearse breath holds. The scan will take no longer than 10 minutes. As a patient, you must remain still throughout the scan and may be asked to hold your breath at various intervals. The CT exam will produce an excellent 3D projection with good visualisation of the lung tissue and any potential damage done to it as a result of coronavirus.

## Radiation Dose to the Patient During a CT Examination

**_TD;LR - There's no need to be afraid_**

Although the radiation dose for CT is classified as a high dose technique, it is relatively low in comparison to some everyday tasks and is equivalent to smoking 140 cigarettes, driving 6,000km in a car or flying 40,000km in a plane.
