Due to COVID-19 being a recent discovery not much literature has been published nor a lot of study done. The main mode of testing for the virus is by taking a swab test; this is when a cotton swab is inserted into the nasaopharyngeal cavity (up the nose :nose:) from both nostrils in order to take enough material. This speciman is then taken to a lab where they are tested for COVID-19.

The role of imaging in the test for coronavirus is leaning more towards testing the _side effects_ of catching the virus. If you haven't already, check out what we've compiled for you in the "[What is the Side-Effects of COVID?]({{< ref "/docs/what-is-covid/_index.md" >}})" section!
