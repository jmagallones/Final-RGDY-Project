People with diabetes have a higher risk of developing severe complications after contracting the virus. These complications involve pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis and high blood sugar. Diabetic ketoacidosis causes the body to break down fats for energy which results in a buildup of ketones in the blood. Ketones make the blood more acidic which can cause serious health risks such as coma and death. 
Patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are at high risk of developing pneumonia as a result of covid 19. Pneumonia is the inflammation of the air sacs of the lungs. This can be diagnosed by a CT scan which shows the tissues of the lungs in fine detail. A CT scan of the chest may be done to see finer details within the lungs and detect pneumonia that may be more difficult to see on a plain x-ray. A CT scan also shows the airway in great detail. Ultrasound may be used in drainage of pleural effusions as a result of pneumonia.
