COVID-19 is a highly infectious new strain of the Coronaviruses, which are usually respiratory tract infections. One of the unique features of COVID-19 is how differently it impacts each individual. Worldwide numbers of COVID-19 are well into the millions and changing rapidly. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

## How Does it Work??

This virus is spread through droplet transmission - in other words through the respiratory droplets from an infected personâ€™s cough or sneeze. These droplets can also be transmitted through [fomites](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fomite) in the surrounding area; therefore, being in close contact, less than 2 m, of an infected is a common route of transmission. Currently, airborne transmission of COVID-19 is also being investigated. 

## How to Reduce Risk of Getting COVID-19

The best way to prevent yourself from getting the virus is to:

* Wear a face mask when out in public.
* Cough and sneeze into a tissue or your elbow.
* Wash your hands frequently with soap or use hand sanitiser.
* Maintain a physical distance of about 6 feet (2 meters) or more from others.
* Limit social interactions and restrict travel where necessary.
* Avoid touching your face. 

## So You Think You Have It, What are the Symptoms?

COVID-19 has different implications on individuals. 

The most **_common_** symptoms include:

* Fever
* Cough
* Cold
* Fatigue
* Headaches
* Inability to smell or taste

More **_severe_** symptoms include:

* Having shortness of breath or other breathing issues never before encountered.
* Pneumonia

Severe symptoms most likely occur in individuals who are over the age of 65 or individuals with underlying health conditions such as respiratory illnesses, heart conditions, hypertension, and diabetes.  

**_DISCLAIMER: PLEASE CONTACT YOUR GP IF ANY SEVERE SYMPTOMS SHOULD APPEAR_**

## The Testing Process

If you develop symptoms for COVID-19, you must self isolate and contact your GP to arrange for a COVID-19 test. You will receive an appointment for your test and either be tested at a test centre or in your home. With both options, a healthcare worker will insert a swab to the back of your nasal cavity and throat to take a sample of your saliva and mucus. The sample will then be taken to a lab centre for analysis. Usually, it can take up to 3 days to receive your results.

* If you test **negative**, then you do not have the virus and no longer have to self isolate. 
* If you do test **positive** for the virus, you must continue to self isolate until you no longer have symptoms for 5 or more days. You will then need to get re-tested and have a second negative result to stop self isolation. 
* If symptoms return or worsen, seek medical attention **_immediately_**.
