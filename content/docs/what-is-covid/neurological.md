In some cases, COVID-19 may attack the central nervous system, causing neurological symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, muscle weakness, nerve damage, or disorientation. If these symptoms persist, it may be recommended that a patient goes for an MRI of the brain or other parts of the nervous system. 
[MRI]({{< ref "/content/docs/imaging/mri.md" >}}) allows physicians to assess the central nervous system for any abnormalities. 

The most common neurological effects of COVID-19 are stroke and encephalitis, while less common effects include peripheral nerve damage, brain haemorrhage or memory loss. These can be the consequences of severe cases of COVID-19.
