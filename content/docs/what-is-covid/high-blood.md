For people with high blood pressure, they are at a greater risk of getting severely ill with COVID-19 as such a condition can lead to many more health complications including heart failure, stroke, dementia and heart attacks. Good management of blood pressure reduces the risk from COVID-19 and all other consequences of hypertension.

Conditions such as endocrine hypertension, a type of high blood pressure caused by an imbalance of hormones in the body, can use imaging modalities including computed tomography ([CT]({{< ref "/docs/imaging/ct.md" >}})) and [MRI]({{< ref "/ocs/imaging/mri.md" >}}) in order to establish a firm diagnosis, as these disorders often originate in the pituitary gland and the adrenal gland.
