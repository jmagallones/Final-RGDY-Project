Yes it's hard. Not just on you but for everyone affected by the lockdown set to try ease pressure off of the medical professionals in hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices.
**_We're all in this together._**

So while we're at it, why don't we try something new like:

* Gardening
* Painting
* Cooking
* Learning a new instrument
* Reading

Or if you just want to slow down and pace yourself, why not listen to some podcasts? Our personal favourites are:
