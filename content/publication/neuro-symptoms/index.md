abstract: At Nuvance Health, we’re seeing patients who are thankful because they recovered from COVID-19, but are now worried because they have lingering neurological symptoms. Nationwide, a small number of people who recovered from COVID-19 are reporting neurological concerns such as headache, dizziness, lingering loss of smell or taste, muscle weakness, nerve damage, and trouble thinking or concentrating — sometimes called “COVID fog” or “brain fog”.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
