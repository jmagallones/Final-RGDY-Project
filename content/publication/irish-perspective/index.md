abstract: Covid-19 infection predominantly affects the respiratory tract. While the diagnosis is often made by a combination of clinical and positive findings on swab testing, imaging with Chest X-ray and CT are essential in establishing the severity of the disease and monitoring response. Imaging also sometimes suggests the diagnosis in unexpected cases. In this article we review the current imaging in Ireland in symptomatic Covid-19 patients and compare our experience to other countries, particularly China and Italy.
