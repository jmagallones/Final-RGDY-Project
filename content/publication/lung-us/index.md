abstract: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the major current global health issues, due to its high rate of infection and increasing mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that spreads easily from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients through close contact and respiratory droplets, causing a severe acute respiratory infection in a certain percentage of cases.1 It is a challenge for clinicians to provide early diagnosis to isolate patients and prevent the most severe forms of acute distress respiratory syndrome (ARDS) or COVID-19 ARDS (CARDS), which represent a serious burden even for the most advanced medical systems.
